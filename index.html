                <p>Hey I'm Daniel. I'm making this site to quickly show off some coding skills. I've played around with coding a good amount previously - I've built some web scrapers, done some work with <a href="https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy">PsycoPy</a> for a psych research lab, and most recently have been taking a self-guided full-stack developer class.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Outside of coding, I think I've done at least a few cool things. You can check out some quick links to my music in the nav above. You can also see some pictures of my adorable cats. I also skateboard, but I'm not good enough to film it, so no links for that.</p>
